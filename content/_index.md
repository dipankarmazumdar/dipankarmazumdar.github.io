# Dipankar Mazumdar
**Director of Developer Relations @ Cloudera**

I lead worldwide developer initiatives focused on lakehouse and Generative AI currently at Cloudera. My focus is helping engineering teams build reliable & robust data platforms using open-source solutions like [**Apache Iceberg**](https://iceberg.apache.org) and [**Apache Hudi**](https://hudi.apache.org). My prior gigs were in roles such as Software and Data/ML Engineering. I completed my Masters Research on [**Explainable AI**](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2862) in 2021 from Dalhousie University, Canada.

I am the author of the book [**Engineering Lakehouses with Open Table Formats**](https://a.co/d/dPa8Wcn) and have publicly spoken at numerous conferences such as Databricks' Data+AI, Netflix Engineering, ApacheCon, Scale By the Bay, Data Day Texas, among others.
