# Dipankar Mazumdar
**Director of Developer Relations @ Cloudera**

I lead worldwide developer initiatives focused on lakehouse and Generative AI. My focus is helping engineering teams build reliable & robust data platforms using open-source solutions like **Apache Iceberg** and **Apache Hudi**. My prior gigs were in roles such as Software and Data/ML Engineering. I completed my Masters Research on [**'Explainable AI'**](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2862) in 2021 from Dalhousie University, Canada.
