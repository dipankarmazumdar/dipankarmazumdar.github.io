### Featured Presentations

Below are some of my recent sessions covering Apache Iceberg, Hudi, and the Open Lakehouse stack.

1. **[Making Lakehouse Table Formats & Catalogs work for you | Data Engineering Open Forum 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLsMrdfBuwU)**
   *This talk will go over XTable's architecture and its capabilities, designed to support omnidirectional translation between open table formats. By utilizing shared metadata information, XTable enables continuous metadata translation across these formats, allowing data to be accessed by various compute engines and workflows without duplication or extensive rewrites*

2. **[Why Apache Iceberg & Open Lakehouse is the Foundation for Data & AI Workloads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqxXQNCIE0o)**
   *Dipankar unpacks why Apache Iceberg has emerged as the foundation of the open lakehouse - and why it’s increasingly essential for modern Data & AI workloads.*

3. **[Building Minimalistic Open Lakehouse w/ Open Source Projects Apache Spark™: Project Nessie & Iceberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMOycqeqlmM)**
   *Though this session, the idea is to help data engineers getting their leg into the world of data lakehouses, easily learn and implement it. We will go through a Notebook-style presentation to show beginners how to build a minimalistic functional lakehouse using Apache Spark, Project Nessie and Iceberg.*
